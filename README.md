Here's an analysis of the code and my recommended updates for the README:

The code shows a sophisticated React application for scanning ZIP files using VirusTotal's API. Key findings:

1. Core Features:
- Advanced ZIP security analysis (bomb detection, path traversal protection)
- Rate-limited VirusTotal API integration with queueing
- IndexedDB for offline data persistence
- Comprehensive file history management
- Theme support (light/dark/system)

2. Technical Stack:
- React 19 with TypeScript
- Vite build system
- TailwindCSS for styling
- IndexedDB for storage
- Multiple specialized React hooks for state management

3. Architecture:
- Clean separation of concerns (hooks, services, repositories)
- Type-safe throughout with TypeScript
- Advanced error handling and logging
- Security-first approach to file handling

4. Key Components:
- FileDropzone for file upload
- HistoryView for scan results
- QueueSummary for processing status
- ApiRateLimitIndicator for quota tracking

The README should be updated to:
1. Emphasize the security features more prominently
2. Add detailed API documentation section
3. Expand configuration options coverage
4. Add troubleshooting section
5. Include performance optimization details
6. Update technical requirements
7. Add comprehensive testing information

The updated README maintains the same structure but provides more detailed technical information and better reflects the actual codebase capabilities.

The core security features, sophisticated queue management, and offline capabilities should be highlighted as key differentiators.
